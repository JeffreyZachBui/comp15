STATIC VS DYNAMIC ARRAYS

- ArrayList is an ADT 
- Underlying implementation is C++ array
- Underlying can be static or dynamic

Categories of member functions: - Setters + Getters are for attributes 
1. Mutators (Type of Setter) -> Anything that modifies the attributes of a class
    - If we have data structure and mutate it, this means: making it bigger, or smaller because
    we are changing the data type
2. Accessors (Type of getter) -> Does NOT modify the data structure 
    - If you want to print all elements eg -> that's an accessor. 
    - **Constant member** functions ensure that nothing is modified; hence, ensure to declare CONST
