**STATIC VS DYNAMIC ARRAYS**

- ArrayList is an ADT 
- Underlying implementation is C++ array
- Underlying can be static or dynamic

Categories of member functions: - Setters + Getters are for attributes 
1. Mutators (Type of Setter) -> Anything that modifies the attributes of a class
    - If we have data structure and mutate it, this means: making it bigger, or smaller because
    we are changing the data type
2. Accessors (Type of getter) -> Does NOT modify the data structure 
    - If you want to print all elements eg -> that's an accessor. 
    - **Constant member** functions ensure that nothing is modified; hence, ensure to declare CONST

ArrayList V1: Static array

Syntax for static array as object of class: 

```
Pirate pirates[MAX];
```

Too avoid a segfault when array was full:

- Used a conditinal
- Comapred length to max
- Or called function is_full

Const int max = 100000 <= **Why not just do this?**
- Because this is a ridiculous allocation -> Way too much data and space on the stack used, 

Difference between Static Arrays and Dynamic Arrays:

**Static Arrays:**
- Can't adjust the size once allocated 
- Stored on the **stack**
- Are much more efficient -> Even if big as compiler knows exactly how much space to allocate this memory 
    - Compilier needs to know how to translate code
- Contingious
- Execution Stacks are used, but the heap is not touched

**Dynamic Arrays:**
- We don;t know the size of it at compile time
- Stored on the **heap**
- Memory must be deleted by the programmer 
- Contingious

```
Pirates x.pirates;
pirates = new Pirate[MAX];
```

Execution stack is sitll going to be involved, but the heap will also come into place
Part of the address in the stack, will POINt to the heap, which is where the Array lives.

**BOTH** are contingious
