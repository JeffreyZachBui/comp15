**STATIC VS DYNAMIC ARRAYS**

- ArrayList is an ADT 
- Underlying implementation is C++ array
- Underlying can be static or dynamic

Categories of member functions: - Setters + Getters are for attributes 
1. Mutators (Type of Setter) -> Anything that modifies the attributes of a class
    - If we have data structure and mutate it, this means: making it bigger, or smaller because
    we are changing the data type
2. Accessors (Type of getter) -> Does NOT modify the data structure 
    - If you want to print all elements eg -> that's an accessor. 
    - **Constant member** functions ensure that nothing is modified; hence, ensure to declare CONST

ArrayList V1: Static array

Syntax for static array as object of class: 

```
Pirate pirates[MAX];
```

Too avoid a segfault when array was full:

- Used a conditinal
- Comapred length to max
- Or called function is_full

Const int max = 100000 <= **Why not just do this?**
- Because this is a ridiculous allocation -> Way too much data and space on the stack used.

- To fix the segfault problem, use a dynamic array instead -> Allows client to keep adding users to array.
- However, if you only allocate 3 spaces in the dynamically allocated array, you'll still have segfault as you try to add the FORTH pirate

```
int main ()
{
    // .. 
    ArrayList gang;
    // ..
    gang.insert_purate(tom);
    gang.insert_purate(tom);
    gang.insert_purate(tom);
    gang.insert_purate(tom);
}
```
This will lead to a **SEGFAULT** 

So the stack has the POINTER, the heap has the array. Right now, computer is trying to find space for the FOURTH guy. 
INstead now, we will **double** the size of the array, and try to find NEW space for the array. We must now copy over the ORIGINAL array
and put it into the new one. 

Static arrays cannot be deleted the reallocated -> you're just stuck with it

So what we will do is EXPAND the Arrays.

1. We will first use the insert function to fill up the arrays. This will check for # of pirates VS the capacity of the array. 
    - Is there enough space? 
2. If not, must make a new array and COPY over the old one

```
ArrayList:inserts(string pirate_name)
    if (**conditional**)
    {
        expand();
        insert_pirate();
    }
```

We want the expand function to do is:
1. Make a new array that's twice as big.
2. Copy the old one into
3. Then delete the old one.

This will look like: 

Pseudocode:
1. Create a temporary array of updated capacity
2. Capacity *= 2

3. Copy elements of old array into new one

```
for (int i = 0; i < old_size; i++)
{
    temp[i] = old[i]
}
```

    - This will lead to TWO pointers leading to TWO different arrays in the HEAP


4. Delete old array 

So the pointer that way pointing to the OLD array, will now be pointing to the NEW one.

```
void ArrayList::expand_list()
{
    if (is_full() = true)
    {

    }
}
```

You don't want to make it so you increase capacity by 1 everytime, as if you do this, there will be significantly more steps. However,
if you double it instead, this will reduce number of steps (you won't have to keep making a new array).

Static Array steps:
1. Insert - 1 step
2. But might seg fault

Dynamnic Array
1. Insert is usually 1 step

**Difference between Static Arrays and Dynamic Arrays:**

**Static Arrays:**
- Can't adjust the size once allocated 
- Stored on the **stack**
- Are much more efficient -> Even if big as compiler knows exactly how much space to allocate this memory 
    - Compilier needs to know how to translate code
- Contingious
- Execution Stacks are used, but the heap is not touched

**Dynamic Arrays:**
- We don;t know the size of it at compile time
- Stored on the **heap**
- Memory must be deleted by the programmer 
- Contingious


```
Pirates x.pirates;
pirates = new Pirate[MAX];
```

Execution stack is sitll going to be involved, but the heap will also come into place
Part of the address in the stack, will POINt to the heap, which is where the Array lives.

**BOTH** are contingious
