STATIC VS DYNAMIC ARRAYS

- ArrayList is an ADT 
- Underlying implementation is C++ array
- Underlying can be static or dynamic

Categories of member functions: - Setters + Getters are for attributes 
1. Mutators (Type of Setter) -> Anything that modifies the attributes of a class
    - If we have data structure and mutate it, this means: making it bigger, or smaller because
    we are changing the data type
2. Accessors (Type of getter) -> Does NOT modify the data structure 
    - If you want to print all elements eg -> that's an accessor. 
    - **Constant member** functions ensure that nothing is modified; hence, ensure to declare CONST

ArrayList V1: Static array

Syntax for static array as object of class: 

```
Pirate pirates[MAX];
```

Too avoid a segfault when array was full:

- Used a conditinal
- Comapred length to max
- Or called function is_full

Const int max = 100000 <= **Why not just do this?**
- Because this is a ridiculous allocation -> Way too much data and space on the stack used, 

Difference between Static Arrays and Dynamic Arrays:

Static Arrays:
- Can't adjust the size once allocated 
- Stored on the **stack**
- Are much more efficient -> Even if big as compiler knows exactly how much space to allocate this memory 
    - Compilier needs to know how to translate code
- Contingious

Dynamic Arrays:
- We don;t know the size of it at compile time
- Stored on the **heap**
- Memory must be deleted by the programmer 
- Contingious

**BOTH** are contingious
