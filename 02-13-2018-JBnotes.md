1. Binary Trees
2. Traversals + recursion
3. Helper Functions

**Binary Trees**

Binary Tree - every node has 0, 1, or 2 children
Lead: node with no children
Depth of a node is distane from root
height: depth of the depest node


**Binary Search Trees**

- They do not allow duplicates
- Is a binary tree
- Nodes:
    - Left: Smaller than me 
    - Right: Bigger than me
- If you start off with an outlier, you have a more degenerate tree

**Traversals + Recursion**

- Every subtree of a binary tree, is a binary tree
- Good for recursion
    - Everytime we use a function to search through - most of the time it'll be recursive
    - Recusion:
        - Calls itself
        - Base case -> Smallest subproblem - usually base case is empty tree
        - Recursive step: conditional
        - Make problem smaller

**Binary Tree**

typedef int TreeItem;

```
struct BinaryNode
{
    TreeItem value
    BinaryNode *left
    BinaryNode *right
}

class BinaryTree Class
{
    protected: // instead of private
        BinaryNode *root
}

```

protected attributes can be used by classes that inheritate this

```
class BST: public BT // this is the syntax to show that BST inherits BT
```
Anytime we declare a BT object, it will have a root attribute.

BT and BST traversals are **identical**

- Traversals are when we visit every node in the tree
- Traversal example: Printing every node (preorder)
- Psuedo code:
    - Print the root
    - Recursively print left sub tree
    - Recursively print right sub tree

**How to print an entire tree**
```

    struct TreeNode 
    {
        int item;         // The data in this node.
        TreeNode *left;   // Pointer to the left subtree.
        TreeNode *right;  // Pointer to the right subtree.
    }
    void print_pre(BinaryNode *tree, ostream &out)
    {
        if (tree!= NULL)
        {
            out << tree-> value;
            print_pre(tree->left, out)
            print_pre(tree->right, out)
        }
        else
            return
    }

```

**Helper/Wrapper Functions**
```
    Driver: BinaryTree *bt = new Binary Tree 

    //insert

    print_pre(bst->root, out) // **we CANT do this because variables were private**
                              // We don't want client to be able to delete root as thats a pointer
                              // We don't want to give client access to mess up
                              // Instead, we'll have a second function - a member function (unlike the print which is a helper
                             
    // Instead, we want to do this
    bt->preorder(cout);
 
```
We now want to use a member function to call the helper function
```
    // Member function -> job is to pass in the ROOT to the helper function
    // Member functions have access to the driver
    // Only job is to call the other function
    void BinaryTree::preorder(ostream &out)
    {
        prin_pre(root, out); // first call to the recursive function
    }
```
