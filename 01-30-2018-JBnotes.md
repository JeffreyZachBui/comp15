**Runtime Complexity**

- Measure efficiency of algorithims 
- # steps relative to size of input 
- as in input grows arbitrarily large
    - # of elements stored in structure
    - Anything we can measure in a constant number of sets, or take the SAME amount of time regardles
      of number of inputs - this property is called constant runtime.
        - Looking at every element 
        - Linear growth - > if linked list has 10 elements -> then 10 steps, 30 elements -> 30 steps
        - upperbound: O ('Big O')
        - Put a known cap on runtime -> we put these bounds so we can compare our algorithims
        ```
        - O(1) constant
        - O(lgn) logarihtmic -> means it takes log(n) steps
        - O(n) linear
        - O(n^k) polynomial
        ```
        - These basically indicate the number of steps needed dependent on the input size
        - These are all good as it makes sense for when input size increases, so doe shte number of steps.

        - However, for certains types, they don't work well
        ```
        - O(k^n) exponential 
        - O(n!) factorial
        ```

**LinkedList Operations**
Offers:
- Dynamic memory allocation
- O(i) insert 
- length == capacity -> thus, NO WASTED memory, we allocated ONLY what we need at that 
  moment then deallocate it when we don't need it.

- paints to first element
- lasts elements points to null
- inersert at front
- Elements are NOT contingious in memory and are placed in different parts of the memory
    - So elements placed 'next to eachtoher' are not actually adjacent in memory
- When you remove an element
- Is_full in a linked list

    - runs out of space on the heap
    - allocation with NEW doesn't work and  throws an exception
    - Exception: disrupts flow of control
    - In our code, we try to catch it
        - We can catch an exception object
        
    ```
    try
    {
            allocate
    }
    catch(bad allocation e){
        executed if allocation fails
    }
